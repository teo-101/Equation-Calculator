## &bullet; Description:
&emsp; A 1st and 2nd degree equation solver made using JavaScript.

## &bullet; What is a Second Degree Equation:
&emsp; A second degree equation is a mathematical phrase with a variable that is raised to the power of 2. Unlike a 1st degree equation, x will have two real values ( **R** ). The general form for a 2nd degree equation is:<br>
<center><b>ax<sup>2</sup> + bx +c = 0</b></center><br>

Where a, b and c are the coefficients for the equation and follow these rules:<br>
<center>a&#8364;R* &emsp; b&#8364;R &emsp; c&#8364;R</center><br>

## &bullet; The Discriminant:
&emsp; The Discriminant is a expression represented by the Greek letter **Delta** ( &#916; ) that shows which of the three cases apply for the equation:

### Delta &#916; > 0:
&emsp; If &#916; is > than 0 => two distinct real roots ( x<sub>1,2</sub> ).

### Delta &#916; = 0:
&emsp; If &#916; is = to 0 => one distinct real root ( x<sub>1</sub> = x<sub>2</sub> ).

### Delta &#916; < 0:
&emsp; If &#916; is negativ ( &#916; < 0 ) => zero real roots ( &#8709; ).
